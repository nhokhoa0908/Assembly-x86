In the provided assembly code, it may appear that arguments are pushed onto the stack in reverse order. This is because x86 architectures, particularly in the System V ABI (Application Binary Interface) commonly used in Unix-like operating systems, follow a convention where arguments are pushed onto the stack from right to left.

Let's analyze the relevant part of the code:

```assembly
push 123
push msg
call printf
```

In these lines, `123` is pushed onto the stack first, and then the address of the `msg` string is pushed onto the stack. When the `printf` function is called, it expects its arguments in reverse order. This means that the rightmost argument in the function call (`msg` in this case) is the first one pushed onto the stack, and the leftmost argument (`123` in this case) is the last one pushed onto the stack.

The calling convention ensures that the callee (in this case, `printf`) can easily access its arguments by popping them off the stack in order. This convention simplifies the implementation of functions and makes it more efficient.

So, when you see arguments being pushed onto the stack seemingly in reverse order, it's part of the calling convention used by the architecture and ABI, not an arbitrary choice made by the programmer. The order of pushing and popping is designed to facilitate function calls and parameter passing.
